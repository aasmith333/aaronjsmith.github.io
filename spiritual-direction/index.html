  <h1>Spiritual Direction</h1>
  <p class="lede">
   Hi. I’m Aaron.

I am a poet, a theologian, and a spiritual director. I’ve been deconstructing and reconstructing my faith for over twenty years, and I believe that faith is a process, not a set of certainties.

When approaching spiritual direction, I don’t believe I have all the answers to offer, but rather I offer a presence and the ability to hold space for what you are going through as the Spirit does her work in your life. I offer another ear to help hear what God is saying to you, what you are saying to God, and what you are saying to yourself.

Hearing the divine through a trauma informed lens allows you to trust yourself, find healing for spiritual wounds, and open space in yourself to trust what you and God are doing.

I am fully queer inclusive, love working with people who are deconstructing their faith, and I believe that no matter what your relationship with church is, you have a place at God’s table.

If you are interested in spiritual direction, have questions, or would like to set up a consultation, fill out the form below and I’ll be in touch.
